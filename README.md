## 💼 Portfolio Overview  
This portfolio highlights a selection of my web projects — ranging from full websites to micro-interactive experiences — all built with care for user experience, responsiveness, clean code, and deployment via GitHub Pages.  
Each project showcases my ability to plan, build, style, and polish a web product.

### Featured Projects  

#### **“Boppys”** – Chicken Shop Website  
Boppys Chicken Shop is a fully responsive, multi-page e-commerce style website created as a portfolio project to demonstrate modern front-end design and interactivity. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site showcases a fictional chicken restaurant brand with a fully functional cart system, dynamic menu search and filter, day/night mode toggle, and a hidden “secret menu” Easter egg for users to discover. It features a responsive hero image slideshow, an interactive merch carousel powered by Swiper.js, and multiple themed pages for a complete browsing experience. Every component—from the menu layout to the live item counter—was developed with usability and responsive design in mind, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes. Deployed via GitHub Pages, Boppy’s Chicken Shop highlights both creative branding and technical execution, combining playful design with real-world e-commerce functionality.

#### **“Peak Performance”** – Gym Website  
A responsive gym-brand website designed to showcase a modern fitness identity. Built with HTML and CSS — clean layouts, tiered membership pricing, and a location finder section. The design focuses on clarity, mobile responsiveness and a strong visual hierarchy reflective of the brand’s energetic, professional style.   

#### **“Don’t Touch the Button”** – Interactive Web Experience  
A fun, engaging web experience built to test user self-control and responsiveness. Created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript — features a persistent button that challenges the user to resist clicking, plus dynamic feedback and timer behaviour. This project highlights my ability to craft engaging micro-interactions, maintain clean UI behaviour code, and build playful experiences with polish.   

*And more projects covering websites, JavaScript mini-games, CSS art, to-do apps, and social link pages.*
