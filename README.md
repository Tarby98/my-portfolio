## 💼 Portfolio Overview  
This portfolio highlights a selection of my web projects — ranging from full websites to micro-interactive experiences — all built with care for user experience, responsiveness, clean code, and deployment via GitHub Pages.  
Each project showcases my ability to plan, build, style, and polish a web product.

### Featured Projects

A vibrant, multi-page music festival website designed to capture the excitement and energy of a live event. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript — the site features a fully responsive layout, intuitive navigation, and visually engaging sections for lineup, schedule, ticket details, and FAQs.  
The design emphasizes clarity and atmosphere, combining bold imagery with clean typography to create an immersive festival experience.  

#### **“Peak Performance”** – Gym Website
